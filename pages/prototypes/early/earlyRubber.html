<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These simple and rather primitive prototypes were built early in the project to test ideas for wrist-wearables in which vibrating motors and <span class="caps">LED</span> lights create interesting patterns of light and vibration. A use case for them would be to provide useful non-intrusive notifications for game players. Components are simple and exposed. These prototypes are controlled externally by an Arduino board. Vibrating motors on the band are programmed to play various vibrational patterns at various&nbsp;intensities.</p>
<p>One interesting offshoot of this work is that we discovered that it is possible to create patterns using music composition techniques and standard musical notation (for example, the musical notation application <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lilypond.org/">Lilypond</a> exports <span class="caps">MIDI</span> data which can be used by the device). Using this technique it is possible to compose music control data using standard musical notation, which the Arduino board uses to recreate rhythmic&nbsp;patterns.</p>

<div class="section" id="design-and-research-questions">
<h2>Design and research&nbsp;questions</h2>
<p>For application in transmedia games, the idea arose early in the <span class="caps">MGDS</span>-<span class="caps">PET</span> project that players could benefit from non-intrusive notifications that vibrating components placed near, or against, the skin. This early band explored how simple vibrating patterns feel against the skin and wrist and whether arrays of vibrating components could convey symbolic&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>We were motivated to build these prototypes in order to explore the following research&nbsp;questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How do vibrating patterns feel on the&nbsp;wrist?</li>
<li>Does an array of simple vibrating patterns create a richer sensation, or does it become&nbsp;unpleasant?</li>
<li>Can the wrist distinguish between simple&nbsp;patterns?</li>
<li>Can directional information (e.g &#8216;go the left&#8217;) be communicated using this&nbsp;means?</li>
<li>Can symbolic information (e.g textual messages) be represented using vibrating&nbsp;patterns?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="components">
<h2>Components</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Rubber band (cut and fashioned from recycled conveyor-belt&nbsp;material)</li>
<li>8 vibrating motors (their original use is as vibrators for mobile&nbsp;phones)</li>
<li>7 <span class="caps">LED</span>&nbsp;lights</li>
<li>Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller board (power for device comes via this board by <span class="caps">USB</span> cable to a&nbsp;computer)</li>
<li>wiring that connects&nbsp;components</li>
</ul>

<h2>User stories / Use&nbsp;cases</h2>
<p>Pattern used for composing user stories: <em>As a &lt;role&gt;, I want to &lt;goal/desire&gt; so that &lt;benefit&nbsp;occur&gt;.</em></p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Wear the wrist device (Actor: game player, child aged&nbsp;7-12)</dt>
<dd><p class="first"><em>As a game player I want to wear the device so I can feel the device&#8217;s vibrations against my&nbsp;wrist.</em></p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>The player wants a device that fits her wrist and provides sensations, which are novel, pleasant and feel&nbsp;good.</li>
<li>However, these early rubber band designs were not designed for wearability, but more to test arrays of vibrotactile motors worn on the&nbsp;wrist.</li>
<li>Vibrations can be felt on the wrist but because of the thickness of the rubber band it is difficult to feel specific motors; the whole band tends to&nbsp;vibrate.</li>
<li>As well, stylistically, the bands have a &#8216;Gothic&#8217; or industrial style, which may not be appropriate for&nbsp;children.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Recognize a vibrating pattern to help play the game more effectively (Actor: game&nbsp;player)</dt>
<dd><p class="first"><em>As a game player I want the device to guide me and help me play the game&nbsp;better.</em></p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>Game designer will create vibrational patterns embedded in the game&#8217;s content, cued to arise at appropriate narrative points during the&nbsp;game.</li>
<li>These patterns can be directional in nature, e.g. &#8216;go the right to find a potential&nbsp;treasure,&#8217;</li>
<li>Or they can notify the player when events happen, such as when a treasure is&nbsp;earned.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Compose a simple, sequential rhythmic pattern (Actor: content&nbsp;creator)</dt>
<dd><p class="first"><em>As a content creator I want to be able to create interesting vibrating patterns that could be used in various narrative&nbsp;situations.</em></p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>These patterns incorporate the band&#8217;s vibrating motors and <span class="caps">LED</span>&nbsp;lights.</li>
<li>They are designed on a computer using music notational and compositional techniques and then loaded onto the microcontroller board with a <span class="caps">USB</span>&nbsp;cable.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Load composed vibrational pattern from computer so that device can use it (Actor: content&nbsp;creator)</dt>
<dd><p class="first"><em>As a content creator I want to be able to transmit a composed pattern onto the&nbsp;device.</em></p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>The wrist device is controlled by an Arduino microcontroller board. These boards, which provide the device&#8217;s &#8216;brains,&#8217; come in various sizes and can be made quite small. The computational demands placed on the microcontroller by the device is&nbsp;minimal.</li>
<li>In practice, transmission of patterns onto the device is built into the Arduino&nbsp;platform.</li>

<h2>Discussion and&nbsp;results</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>The feel of vibrating patterns on the&nbsp;wrist</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Vibrating patterns on the wrist are not uncomfortable, but they do take time to get used&nbsp;to.</li>
<li>Some people are sensitive to such stimulation. If you expect the vibration, as for instance in the course of game-play, then it likely is less intrusive than if it is&nbsp;unexpected.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Distinguishing between simple patterns by&nbsp;wrist.</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Pattern can made be rhythmically distinct and people have little difficulty in distinguishing them. This would depend on the length of the pattern and its repetition. The literature states that the tactile resolution is a fraction of aural resolution using the&nbsp;ears.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Directional information using vibrational&nbsp;arrays</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>These prototypes encircle the wrist. Therefore, their orientation is not fixed on any plane. It is unclear whether they could be used to point in various directions and provide useful orienteering&nbsp;information.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>Representing symbolic information using vibrating&nbsp;patterns</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Given that the tactile resolution on the wrist is modest if doubtful that such a device could provide useful transmittal of symbolic information without extensive user training. The blind reading braille generally use their finger tips, which are much better able to perceive differences in texture and&nbsp;pattern.</li>
